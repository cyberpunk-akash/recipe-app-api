# Recipe App API  
The recipe app API lets you create, modify and view tags and ingredients. You can create your own custom recipes using these tags and ingredients.  

## Technology Stack:  
**Language**: Python3  
**Frameworks**: Django2, Django-REST

## How to run the application?
You need to follow these steps after cloning:
- Install python3
- Install pip
- Install Docker
- Configure PostgreSQL on the system
- Change the password of PostgreSQL in docker-compose.yml file
- Install a text editor(preferably Atom or Sublime) to view the files.
- Run the commands:
```docker
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up
```
- If the last command doesn't show any error, the API will be available at _localhost:8000_
